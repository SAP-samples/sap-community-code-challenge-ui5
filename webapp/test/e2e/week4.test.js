You have all done a great job so far in building an app that passes predefined tests 🎉
Now it's time to take it one step further and write your own tests 🚀
For week 4 the task is to write a minimum of 2 tests and make them pass ✅✅
There are no boundaries, get creative and explore the framework 🎨

You can get inspiration here:
    🗓  test files of the previous weeks
